<h2>Places To Visit In Germany</h2>
<ul>
<li>
	<h3>Berlin</h3>
	<img src="img/Germany/berlin.jpg">
	<p>A federal state and the capital city of Germany, Berlin is widely associated with its World War II history and former division of East and West Germany by the Berlin Wall during the Cold War. Since the fall of the historic wall in 1989, Berlin today is now a vast, unified city diverse in ethnic groups and abundant in sightseeing attractions, culture and nightlife. Many tourists are drawn to Berlin’s famous historic structures, which include the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag. Although most of the Berlin Wall was demolished, there are some portions still standing near Checkpoint Charlie and Reichstag.</p>

 	<h3>Rugen Island</h3>

 	<p>Located in the Baltic Sea, Rugen Island is the largest island in Germany, connected to the mainland by the Rugen Bridge and Rugen Causeway. Charming villas, romantic seaside resorts and beautiful beaches all draw tourists to Rugen Island, but the star attraction is the Jasmund National Park, famous for its unique chalk cliffs rising 528 feet (161 meters) over the sea. Another notable feature of Rugen Island is Cape Arkona, East Germany’s northernmost tip, where tourists can visit an old lighthouse, remnants of a Slavic castle and a picturesque fishing village.</p>

	<h3>Dresden</h3>

	<p>Before it was severely damaged from World War II bombings, Dresden was known as the Jewel Box because of its lavish collection of stunning art and architecture. After many years, the city has restored much of its former glory. The capital of the federal state of Saxony, Dresden offers a number of historic sites like the stunning Frauenkirche cathedral. The city also boasts many cultural institutions of which the Semper Opera is most widely esteemed.</p>

	<h3>Heidelberg</h3>
	<img src="img/Germany/heidelberg.jpg">
	<p>With historic treasures like the medieval Old Bridge, the Heidelberg Castle, the Church of the Holy Spirit and the Knight St. George House, it is no wonder that Heidelberg is a popular tourist attraction. The city center’s main street, Haupstrasse, is packed with pubs, restaurants, museums, art galleries, shops and markets selling the likes of beer steins, cuckoo clocks and German sausages. Home to Germany’s oldest university, Heidelberg’s long academic history can be retraced along the Philosopher’s Walk, a scenic footpath often walked by many earlier philosophers and professors.</p>

	<h3>Rothenburg Ob Der Tauber.jpg</h3>
	<img src="img/Germany/rothenburg_ob_der_tauber.jpg">
	<p>The walled city of Rothenburg ob der Tauber sits on a plateau overlooking the Tauber river in Bavaria. Straight from the pages of a fairy tale, this Franconian town is famous for its extremely well preserved medieval center. The town itself is small and easily traversable on foot. Be sure to visit the Town Hall, the seat of city government since medieval times. Climb the steps of the 13th-century hall’s tower for stunning views of the city. Rothenburg is also famous for the stores that carry Christmas items all year round and for having an outstanding Christmas market each December.</p>
